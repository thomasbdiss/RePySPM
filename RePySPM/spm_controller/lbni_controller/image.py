class AcquiredImage:
    """
    A class to handle image acquisition and manage image channels.

    This class provides methods to retrieve the names, units, and data for various image channels. 
    It allows users to access specific channels by name and retrieve all channel data.

    Methods:
        get_channels_units: Retrieves the units of all channels in the image.
        get_channels_names: Retrieves the names of all channels in the image.
        get_all_channels_data: Retrieves the data for all image channels.
        get_channel: Retrieves the data of a specific image channel by name.
        get_channels_units_ramp: Retrieves the units of all channels in the ramp.
        get_channels_names_ramp: Retrieves the names of all channels in the ramp.
        get_all_channels_data_ramp: Retrieves the data for all ramp channels.
        get_channel_ramp: Retrieves the data of a specific ramp channel by name.
        get_last_line: Retrieves the data for all last channels line.
        get_all_last_lines: Retrieves the data of the last line of a specific channels.

        scan_auto_save: Enables or disables auto-save.
        scan_save_now: Saves current scan data immediately.
        is_scanning: Checks if scanning is active.
        is_paused: Checks if scanning is paused.
        isContinuousScan: Checks if continuous scanning is enabled.
        isAutoSave: Checks if auto-save is enabled.
        get_pixel_pos: Retrieves the current scanning XY pixel numbers.
        get_line: Retrieves the current scanning line.
        get_xyposition: Retrieves the current XY scanner position.
        set_xyposition: Moves the tip to the desired XY position.
        get_path: Retrieves the path associated with the scan.
        set_path: Sets the path associated with the scan.
        get_file_name: Retrieves the file name for the scan.
        set_file_name: Sets the file name for the scan.
        do_ramp_absolute: Performs a Z ramp with absolute starting and ending points.
        do_ramp_absolute_length: Performs a Z ramp with absolute starting point and ramp length.
        do_ramp_absolute_trig: Performs a Z ramp with an absolute starting point and a trigger-based endpoint.
        do_ramp_relative_length: Performs a Z ramp relative to the actual position with a specified length.
        do_ramp_relative_trig: Performs a Z ramp relative to the actual position with a trigger-based endpoint.
        is_ramping: Checks if the ramping is active.
        get_path_ramp: Retrieves the path for ramp data storage.
        set_path_ramp: Sets the path for ramp data storage.
        get_file_name_ramp: Retrieves the file name for ramp data storage.
        set_file_name_ramp: Sets the file name for ramp data storage.
